description: 'A module for dynamically creating ApolloClient instances.'
---

This module provides a function to dynamically create and configure instances of ApolloClient with a custom GraphQL endpoint. It is designed to facilitate the integration of GraphQL APIs into Vue applications, particularly those using the Apollo client library for data fetching and state management.

```ts
import { provideApolloClient } from '@vue/apollo-composable';
import { createApolloClient } from '@labmesh/kedro-graphql-viz.clients.apollo-client';

// Create an ApolloClient instance
const apolloClient = createApolloClient('https://your-graphql-endpoint');

// Provide the ApolloClient instance to your Vue application
provideApolloClient(apolloClient);
```
